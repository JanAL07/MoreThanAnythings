        <h3>More Than Anything</h3>
        <h5>by Andrew Underberg, Sam Haft, Jeremy Jordan & Erika Henningsen</h5>

        <p>
            Charlie! You don't understand, Heaven never listens! <br>
            They didn't listen to me, they won't listen to you </p>
   
        <p> You don't know that! </p>
   
        <p> I do!<br>
            You didn't know that when I tried this all before<br>
            My dreams were too hard to defend<br>
            And in the end, I won't lose it all again<br>
            Now you're the only thing worth fighting for<br>
            More than anything, more than anything<br>
            I'll shelter and adore you more than anything </p>
   
        <p> Dad, I don't need you to protect me from this </p>
   
        <p> I just don't want you to be crushed by them likeâ€”<br>
            Like I was </p>
       
        <p> Dad... <br>
            When I was young, I didn't really know you at all<br>
            I always felt so small<br>
            But I heard your stories and I was enthralled<br>
            The tales about your lofty dreams, I listened breathlessly<br>
            Imagining it could be me<br>
            So in the end, it's the view I had of you<br>
            That showed me dreams can be worth fighting for<br>
            More than anything, more than anything<br>
            I need to save my people more than anything </p>
   
        <p> I've been dyin' to find out who you are </p>
   
        <p> I've been waiting, wanting the same thing </p>
   
        <p> Looks like the apple doesn't fall far </p>
   
        <p> Took you a while </p>
   
        <p> I've missed that smile </p>
   
        <p> Took you a while </p>
           
        <p> All that I'm hopin', now that my eyes are open<br>
            Is that we can start again, not be pulled apart again<br>
            'Cause in the end, you are part of who I am </p>
   
        <p> I'll support your dream, whatever lies in store </p>
   
        <p> And who could ask for more? </p>
           
        <p> More than anything, more than anything<br>
            More than anything, more than anything </p>
   
        <p> I'm grateful you're my daughter more than anything<br>
            I'm grateful you're my father more than anything </p>
   
        <p> More than anything </p>
